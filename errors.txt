Bad1 had an error that occurred during compile time
The public class name BADOne doesn't match the filename Bad1.java, and so this violates Java's requirement that public class names must match the filename exactly.

Bad2 had an error that ocurred during runtime
The program attempted to divide an integer by zero, which causes an error known as 'ArithmeticException' to happen during the program's execution.

Bad3 had an error that occurred during compile time
The variable letter is declared to be a type String but is assigned a char value, which causes a type mismatch that stops the code from being able to compile.
