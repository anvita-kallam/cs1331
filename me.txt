Hi! My name is Anvita Kallam and I'm a first-year computer science major from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Go Birds!

Besides all things coding and CS, a big interest of mine is backpacking and kayaking. I went on a 2-week backpacking trip in Alaska this past summer, and I'm excited for more opportunities to touch grass!

I chose the asychnonous format of 1331 because I found that when I took 1301 in person, reviewing the lecture material and practice problems in my own time was much more benficial for my learning than just attending lecture.
I understand that everyone learns differently, but this seems to be working for me!
